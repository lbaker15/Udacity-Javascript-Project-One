# Dino Project

This project practices the use of object oriented Javascript to create a form which allows users to compare themselves to species of dinosuars.  After submitting information an object with the users information is instantiated and a grid is appended to the DOM.  Each dinosaur tile contains a random fact which compares the human object properties to dino object properties, these comparisons are carried out via class methods.
